# Gomoku
Gomoku_js:use negamax and alpha-beta to cut useless branches.
##note
1. use Gomoku_beta.js, and Gomoku.js is useless.
2. Gomoku_beta.js is done by myself, but other files is done by my partners.
3. sometime ai's work is a little slow and stupid.
4. more efficient evaluate functions is TODO.
